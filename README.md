THE HEIRS


Kim Tan (Lee Min-ho) is a wealthy heir of the Jeguk Group, a significant Korean corporation. His half-brother Kim Won (Choi Jin-hyuk), who is attempting to take over the family business, exiled him to the United States. He meets Cha Eun-sang (Park Shin-hye) in the United States, who is looking for her sister. Despite being engaged to Yoo Rachel (Kim Ji-won), Eun-sang falls in love with Kim Tan, a fellow heiress. When Kim Tan returns to Korea, Choi Young-do (Kim Woo-bin), his former best friend turned nemesis, begins picking on Eun-sang to aggravate Tan. When Young-do falls in love with Eun-sang, tensions rise, and Kim Tan is forced to choose between his family's company and his love life.

"The Heirs" depicts the friendships, rivalries and love lives of young, rich heirs led by Kim Tan (Lee Min-Ho) and a girl named Cha Eun-Sang (Park Shin-Hye). Unlike the others, Cha Eun-Sang is considered ordinary and comes from a poor background.

Kim Tan is the heir to Empire Group who has been sent to study abroad in the U.S. In reality it's a form of exile, as his elder half-brother back home schemes to take over the family business. While in the States, Kim Tan meets Cha Eun Sang, who arrived from Korea in search of her older sister. He feels himself falling for her, never realizing that she's the daughter of his family's housekeeper. When his fiancée Rachel Yoo arrives to bring him back to Korea, his heart is torn between love and duty.

Overall, though, happy endings abounded for the characters. Kim Tan and Eun-sang solidified their relationship and are looking forward to their time together. Lee Bo-na and Chan-young are as cute as ever.
